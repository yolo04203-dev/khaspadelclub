## White-Label Cleanup Plan

### What needs to change

The codebase has Lovable references in 4 locations. Two are **auto-generated system files that must not be touched** (`src/integrations/lovable/index.ts`, `package-lock.json`). The remaining two are actionable:

### Files to modify

**1. `package.json`** (line 2)
- Change `"name": "vite_react_shadcn_ts"` to `"name": "khas-padel-club"` (not Lovable-branded but generic; worth renaming for clean identity)

**2. `README.md`**
- Replace entire content with a clean Khas Padel Club README (remove all Lovable project links and references)

**3. `capacitor.config.ts`** (line 8)
- Change `appName: 'Khas Padel'` to `appName: 'Khas Padel Club'`

### Files that CANNOT be modified (auto-generated by the platform)
- `src/integrations/lovable/index.ts` — auto-generated auth integration, must stay
- `@lovable.dev/cloud-auth-js` in `package.json` — required runtime dependency
- `lovable-tagger` in `package.json` — dev-only dependency, not in production builds
- `vite.config.ts` — `componentTagger()` only runs in dev mode (line 32: `mode === "development" && componentTagger()`), zero production impact

### Already clean (no changes needed)
- `index.html` — already says "Khas Padel Club" everywhere
- `manifest.json` — already uses "Khas Padel Club" / "Padel Club"
- Footer, Header, landing pages — no Lovable references
- Loading screens — no Lovable references
- Meta tags, OG tags, favicon — all already Khas Padel Club branded
- Theme color — already `#0f1a2d`
- No console logs mention Lovable
- No UI text mentions Lovable

### Summary
Only `package.json` name, `README.md`, and `capacitor.config.ts` appName need updates. Everything user-facing is already fully branded. The remaining `lovable` references are platform infrastructure that doesn't appear in the production build.
